This project is a fully responsive news website UI designed with both light and dark themes to improve user experience. The interface is minimal yet visually structured, ensuring readability and smooth navigation.

Features: 
1. Dual Theme Support – Users can switch between Light Mode (bright, clean interface) and Dark Mode (reduces eye strain in low-light conditions).
2. Main Page Layout – Designed for easy navigation, featuring categorized news sections for better content discovery.
3. News Detail Page – Clicking "Read More" navigates users to a dedicated page with an expanded article view.
4. Authentication Pages – Login & Sign-Up pages maintain a consistent style across both themes.
5. Breaking News Animation – The breaking news updates automatically every 5 seconds, ensuring users stay informed without refreshing the page or affecting other content.

UI Design:

1. Clean and Structured Layout:
  The main page follows a two-column layout, where users can see trending news alongside top headlines.
  A grid-based news category section allows users to explore different topics effortlessly.

3. Dark & Light Theme Implementation:
  Dark Mode enhances readability at night and reduces eye strain.
  Light Mode provides a traditional reading experience suitable for daytime usage.

5. Navigation Simplicity:
  The Login & Sign-Up pages are minimalistic and user-friendly.
  Clicking on a news article transitions seamlessly to a detailed news page.
  Easy Theme Switching – Users can toggle between themes by clicking the theme switch icon in the navbar.

How to Use
1. Open the main page, where users can browse trending and latest news.
2. Click on "Read More" to navigate to the detailed news section.
3. Use the authentication pages for signing up or logging in and for navigating to the main page, click on the logo in the login and signup page.
4. Switch between light and dark themes easily from the navbar icon.

This design ensures a modern, accessible, and user-friendly experience while maintaining a professional and engaging layout.
